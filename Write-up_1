1. I hope to answer the following question: What single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) show a
highly significant association with the disease glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)?

2. I’m planning to use the GenBank database.

3. So far, I know the following about the GenBank database:
- This data contains publicly available nucleotide sequences for over 300, 000 formally
described species.
- The format design is that of a tabular approach and consists of a feature key, a location,
and qualifiers.
- It contains over 180 billion nucleotides of DNA sequences

4. I’ve previously studied a novel drug delivery approach for the treatment of neurodegenerative
diseases. I think that it will be interesting to find out the SNPs that influence our susceptibility
to GBM, the most aggressive form of brain tumors.
