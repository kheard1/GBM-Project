Task 1:  Review recent empirically based research articles to determine what SNPs are significantly associated with GBM.  
         One example would be the carriage of the T allele of the rs16906252 SNP stated by Rapkins et al in Neuro-Oncology. 
Task 2:  Utilize a database-mining approach on genomic data from GenBank in order to find other SNPs in another region of the chromosome.  
Task 3:  TBC
